Janie things to implement:

* Design an action object
 - selector
- target
- rect in percentages of size - these must be reset and live in ImageView which must have user interaction turned on.


* Either or both english or Spanish
* pinch to zoom image
* play correct audio if we're in Spanish

What we did between classes:

* Book Reading Options
* send notification so no back pointers
* use of ~ipad nib to fit ipad better

We need to add:
* audio end callback for autoplay
* autoplay of pages

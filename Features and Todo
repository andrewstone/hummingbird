Janie things to implement:

* Design an action object
 - selector
- target
- rect in percentages of size - these must be reset and live in ImageView which must have user interaction turned on.


* Either or both english or Spanish
* pinch to zoom image
* play correct audio if we're in Spanish

What we did between classes:

* Book Reading Options
* send notification so no back pointers
* use of ~ipad nib to fit ipad better

Added:
* audio end callback for autoplay
* autoplay of pages

Implementing word by word via NSAttributed String:
GIVEN: for each word, the time as float seconds right before word is pronounced
word list: each item represents a word:
    NSRange start,length   (for quick selection)
    NSTimeInterval startTime (duration can be calc'd by next startTime)

Future Ideas for Book:

1. hot spot which could play audio


Bugs:
1. if landscape - autoplay crashes
